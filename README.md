# FireWatch Pro üî•  
**Early Wildfire Detection & Alert System**  

---

## üìñ Overview  
Inspired by wildfire incidents in Los Angeles, **FireWatch Pro** is a hardware-software solution that detects fires in remote areas (e.g., farms, forests) and sends real-time alerts with geolocation to users and emergency services. The system combines IoT sensors, a mobile app, and cloud infrastructure to prevent disasters.  

---

## üö® Problem Statement  
Wildfires in remote regions often go undetected until they escalate. Traditional systems lack real-time geolocated alerts, leaving farmers and landowners vulnerable.  

---

## üí° Solution  
1. **Hardware Device**: Detects fires using multi-sensor technology.  
2. **Mobile App**: Sends alerts with GPS coordinates to users and fire departments.  
3. **Premium Features**: Custom software for large-scale deployments (e.g., farms, industrial sites).
